        "We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita. 
        Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says, <strong>'Now, I am become Death,<br> the destroyer of worlds.'</strong> I suppose we all thought that one way or another."
